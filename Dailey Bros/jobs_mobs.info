To Do List 

Levels (Save and read file implementation once levels are coded).
- At the end of every battle, check exp to see if level up should be called.
- Increment level if exp is a certain number. Increase threshold for level up.
- Add abilities on level up.
- Add stats on level.
- Reset hp/mp on level up.

Mobs
- Add more mobs.
- Define them in mob_main.h
- Define abilities, stats, different names, etc.

Map
- Add randomized events to the map structure
- Make a battle happen on a random space

Items
- Develop a use for items.
- Give mobs a structure items that contains their possible loot and randomize the drop
- Give an item to user upon defeating the mob.

General 
- Work on creating structs to make items, abilities, map travel, etc. simpler.
- Can functions be refactored and made to be more clear? (This involves detail work
and determining what should be passed into the function).
- File input and save still not implemented. Once levels are working, consider looking into this.
- Work on more story elements. Script, events, etc.


Levels
1 - 50 exp required ...
level_exp = 50;
for (int i = 1; i < 21; i++) {
    cout << i << ": " << level_exp << endl;
    level_exp = level_exp + 50 + i * 25;
}

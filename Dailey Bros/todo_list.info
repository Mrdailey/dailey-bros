To Do List (last edit Sept. 15 2015)


Abilities
- Expand abilities past level 6 for all jobs.
- Perhaps status effects on abilities, none currently in effect on mobs.

Mobs
- Add more mobs.
- Variety of bosses need to be in place.
- Balancing the numbers for all mobs, including the forest feral.

Map
- Add randomized events to the map structure
- Make a battle happen on a random space(need to truly randomize, not using modulus operator)
- Consider redoing map structure entirely from ground up, making it more dynamic, less predictable, and 
much bigger. (ways to do this???)

Items
- Equipment needs to be used in loot tables for mobs.
- Obtaining an item auto equips for increased stats?

General 
- Can functions be refactored and made to be more clear? (This involves detail work
and determining what should be passed into the function).
- Load Game implementation... going to be quite detailed and arduous.
- Work on more story elements. Script, events, etc.


Levels
1 - 50 exp required ...
level_exp = 50;
for (int i = 1; i < 21; i++) {
    cout << i << ": " << level_exp << endl;
    level_exp = level_exp + 50 + i * 25;
}
